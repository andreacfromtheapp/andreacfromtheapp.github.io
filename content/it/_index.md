I am a self-taught engineer with an appetite for knowledge, innovation, and
personal growth.

I have been involved with [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft),
[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
[Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), and
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), since 2002. At first, because of
the ethos, the philosophy, and the philanthropy of it all. Then, as a proponent,
I was involved with writings, ideas, coding, active participation and teachings.
Professionally, for 15+ years and counting.

An akin area of interest was the [Cardano](https://cardano.org)
[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). I partook in the Cardano
ecosystem as a
[stake pool operator](https://docs.cardano.org/operating-a-stake-pool/about-stake-pools/)
since the ITN, and in the IOHK official working group named
[Shelley Pioneer](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/).
Until, one day, I lost anything digitally relevant. Thanks to Cardano I fell in
love with functional programming. With time, I grew disillusioned with
blockchain and cryptocurrency promises. Technologically they have the potential
to allow astounding advancements and infrastructural improvements, in practice
we all know how that's going.

After my [failed attempt at professional sound design](/content/sound/), I've
been back to the IT industry as [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)
and I keep upskilling. Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science fundamentals,
Software Egineering, SDLC, AppSec, Build and Release engineering. With a focus
on Rust and technologies such as Leptos, Axum, Crux, and Dioxus.
