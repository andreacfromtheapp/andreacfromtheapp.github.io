I am a self-taught engineer with an appetite for knowledge, innovation, and
personal growth.

I have been involved with [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft),
[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
[Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), and
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), since 2002. At first, because of
the ethos, the philosophy, and the philanthropy of it all. Then, as a proponent,
I was involved with writings, ideas, coding, active participation and teachings.
Professionally, for 15+ years and counting.

After my [failed attempt at professional sound design](/content/sound/), I've
been back to the IT industry and I keep upskilling. Iâ€™m currently learning
Computer Science fundamentals, Software Egineering, SDLC, AppSec, Build and
Release engineering. With a focus on Rust and technologies such as Leptos, Axum,
Crux, and Dioxus.
